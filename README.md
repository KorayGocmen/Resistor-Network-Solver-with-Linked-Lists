# Resistor-network-with-linked-lists
A virtual resistor network program that allows you to insert resistors, modify their resistance value, print the resistor connected to a specific node, print all resistors connected to all nodes, delete resistors, set the voltage of a specific node or unset the voltage of the node and lastly solve the voltages of all the nodes
